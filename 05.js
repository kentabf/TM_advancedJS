/*
A Beginner's Guide to JavaScript's Prototype
*/

/*
"prototype" or `prototype`:
- property that every function in JS has
- allows sharing of methods across all instances of functions
- `getPrototypeOf` allows get instance of prototype

`for (let key in <Obj>)` allows iteration through all fields, including functions in accompanying prototype

`hasOwnProperty` checks whether it's in itself

arrow functions don't have `this` or `prototype`
